# Simple-Calculator-App
## About the project
A simple calculator app created in Python that allows the user to input numbers; the calculator then evaluates the value and displays the result for the user. 

### To run the program
1. Open the file.
2. Run the Python code. It will display a calculator.
3. Input numbers and it will evaluate the inputs.
4. It will show errors if the input is a math error or a syntax error.
5. The program will ask if the user would like to try again.
6. If the user clicks "yes", the calculator will automatically clear and the user can input numbers again.
7. If the user clicks "no", a new window opens with a thank you message and a button to close the app.
